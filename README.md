# ExplainableAI-MNIST

This project provides pedagogical guidance for implementing layer-by-layer relevance propagation using the MNIST dataset as an example.
By adding noise to the images of handwritten numbers, we try to interpret which pixels get the most relevance for identifying the handwritten numbers.

Here we consider a fully connected DNN.
We identify features of how handwritten numbers can be identified.

The project is presented in an I-Python notebook.
