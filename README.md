# ExplainableAI-MNIST

This project contains a pedagodical guide on how to implement layer-wise relevance propagation on the example of the MNIST dataset.
By adding noise to the images of handwritten numbers, we try to interprete which pixels get most relevance for identifying the handwritten numbers.

Here we consider a fully connected DNN.
We identify features on how handwritten numbers can be identified.
